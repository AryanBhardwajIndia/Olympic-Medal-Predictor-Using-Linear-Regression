# Olympic-Medal-Predictor-Using-Linear-Regression

First ML project inspired by @dataquestio, platform used is Google Colab, libraries used are mentioned below:

1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Sklearn
4. Numpy

Started by forming an hypothesis and then collecting data regarding it. After this, data is arranged as per the requirement, data is cleaned (null values removed). Model used in this one is Linear Regression Model which is not as efficient as there are discrepancies in the predicted data but it does the work. Further different models can be used to train and predict the values.
